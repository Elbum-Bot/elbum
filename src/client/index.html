  <!-- this html is as close to identical to what's produced by the
  elm compiler's '--output index.html' as possible.

  two seemingly subtle things that seem like they shouldn't matter but
  are required to get things to load at all:

  (1) the tag must be <script></script> rather than <script/>

  (2) the inline script that invokes elm must be in the body, not the
  head.-->
